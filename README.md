# CommAI: Analyzing Human Communication Skills Through Text and Speech Interaction

An AI conversation typically involves a user interacting with an AI model to seek information, ask questions, or explore ideas. The AI responds in a conversational manner, aiming to provide relevant and helpful answers based on its training. The conversation can range from casual chats to more in-depth discussions on various topics, such as technology, education, entertainment, and more.

## Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered conversation platform designed to simulate human-like dialogues. Using advanced natural language processing models, the platform enables seamless interaction between users and the AI, handling various tasks like customer service, personal assistants, and more.

## Features

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: The AI can understand and process human language in various contexts.

2. **Interactive Conversations**: Users can have real-time conversations with the AI.

3. **Multiple Language Support**: The platform supports multiple languages.

4. **Context Awareness**: The AI retains context within conversations for more personalized interactions.

5. **Customizable**: Developers can fine-tune the AI for specific use cases, industries, or domains.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/OnlyCR7/CommAI.git
cd CommAI
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3. **Run the AI conversation platform:**
```
python app.py
```

## Tech Stack

Frameworks Supported: Flask etc.
Languages: Python, JavaScript etc.
Libraries: OllamaLLM, langchain_ollama, langchain_core, NumPy, scikit-learn etc.


## Usage

Once the platform is running, you can initiate a conversation by typing a message in the input field. The AI will respond in real-time based on the context and the conversation flow.

Example conversation:
```
User: Hello AI?

AI: I am CommAI, Nice to meet you! let's start our conversation.
```

**AI Model**

The platform leverages cutting-edge models such as OllamaLLM model, allowing it to generate human-like responses. These models are pre-trained on diverse datasets and fine-tuned for conversational tasks.

## Color Reference

Primary colors used in the project:

|Primary: linear-gradient(135deg, #e4b1c4, #b6e1f4)
|:------------------

|Secondary: #e4b1c4, #b6e1f4

## Customization

You can modify the conversation behavior by adjusting the AI's settings in conversations.json. The configuration allows you to set parameters like response length, temperature (for randomness), and model selection.
